## Description
I put my flag into this program, but now I lost the flag. Here is the program, and the output. Could you use it to find the flag?

## Distribution
comparing.cpp
output.txt

## writeup
You can go through the output two at a time to retrieve each pair of pairs of the characters of the flag in its proper index until you have the flag.
